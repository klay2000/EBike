# Ebike

This repo contains the software and CAD files for my ebike.

## Software

All the software is currently written in arduino.

## Hardware

All the CAD files are made in Fusion 360 and are put here in iges format. At the moment my ebike runs a 48 volt brushless motor running at 30 amps. My motor is powered by a FSESC motor controller, which I interface with over UART with an stm-32 running arduino. My battery is a 48 volt 14AH li-ion battery pack.
